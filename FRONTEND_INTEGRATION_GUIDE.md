# üöÄ Backend API Integration Guide: 4-Stage Conversation System

## üìã Overview

The PLC-Copilot backend provides a robust 4-stage conversation system with intelligent stage detection, MCQ support, and cost optimization. Here's everything you need to integrate with these endpoints.

## üéØ Core Conversation Stages

The system follows a logical progression:

1. **`project_kickoff`** - Initial project analysis and setup
2. **`gather_requirements`** - Technical Q&A with MCQ support  
3. **`code_generation`** - PLC code generation based on requirements
4. **`refinement_testing`** - Code refinement and testing feedback
5. **`completed`** - Final stage

## üîå Primary API Endpoints

### 1. Start/Continue Conversation
```http
POST /api/v1/conversations/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "I need help with a conveyor belt control system",
  "conversation_id": null,  // null for new conversation
  "force_stage": null,      // optional: force specific stage
  "attachments": []         // optional: file attachments
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "uuid-string",
  "stage": "project_kickoff",
  "response": "I'll help you design a conveyor belt control system. Let me start by understanding your specific requirements...",
  "next_stage": "gather_requirements",
  "gathering_requirements_estimated_progress": 0.0,

    "project_type": "conveyor_control",
    "requirements": ["emergency_stop", "variable_speed"],
    "generated_code": null
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I need help with a conveyor belt...",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-16T07:00:00Z"
    },

      "timestamp": "2025-09-16T07:00:15Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Force Stage Transition
```http
POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/stage
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target_stage": "gather_requirements",
  "reason": "User wants to add more requirements",
  "force": false
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "previous_stage": "project_kickoff",
  "new_stage": "gather_requirements",
  "message": "Stage transition completed successfully"
}
```

### 4. Reset Conversation
```http
POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/reset?target_stage=project_kickoff
```

### 5. Delete Conversation
```http
DELETE /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}
```

## üéØ MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Functionality

### Structured MCQ Response Format

The system now provides structured MCQ data in the API response for easier frontend integration:

**Example MCQ Response (Focused Requirements Gathering):**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "uuid-string",
  "stage": "gather_requirements", 
  "response": "What safety features do you require for your conveyor system?",
  "next_stage": "gather_requirements",
  "gathering_requirements_estimated_progress": 0.3,
  "suggested_actions": [
    "Select your required safety features from the options below"
  ],
  "is_mcq": true,
  "mcq_question": "What safety features do you require for your conveyor system?",
  "mcq_options": [
    "Emergency stop buttons only",
    "Light curtains for perimeter protection", 
    "Safety mats for operator zones",
    "Comprehensive safety package (all features)"
  ],
  "is_multiselect": false,
  "generated_code": null
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: MCQ Field Usage for Frontend

**CRITICAL**: When `is_mcq` is true, display ONLY the `mcq_question` and `mcq_options` to the user for interaction. The `response` field contains additional context but should not overwhelm the user interface.

**Best Practice MCQ Handling:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use structured MCQ fields for user interaction
const handleApiResponse = (response: ConversationResponse) => {
  if (response.is_mcq) {
    // Display ONLY the focused MCQ question and options
    displayFocusedMCQ({
      question: response.mcq_question,
      options: response.mcq_options
    });
    
    // Optional: Show response context in a collapsible section
    displayContextualInfo(response.response, { collapsible: true });
  } else {
    // Display regular response
    displayRegularResponse(response.response);
  }
};

// ‚úÖ Focused MCQ component - keeps user experience clean
const renderFocusedMCQ = (question: string, options: string[]) => {
  return (
    <div className="mcq-container">
      <h3 className="mcq-question">{question}</h3>
      <div className="mcq-options">
        {options.map((option, index) => (
          <button 
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

// ‚ùå AVOID: Don't overwhelm users with complex MCQ + full response
const avoidComplexMCQDisplay = (response) => {
  // This creates cognitive overload for users
  return `${response.response}\n\nQuestion: ${response.mcq_question}...`;
};
```

### User Experience Principles

1. **Single Focus**: Each `gather_requirements` response contains exactly one focused question
2. **Clean Interface**: MCQ questions stand alone without competing text 
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Additional context available but not forced on user
4. **Clear Action**: Users know exactly what to do next

### MCQ Response Format

When responding to MCQ questions, send the selected option:

```http
POST /api/v1/conversations/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Comprehensive safety package (all features)",
  "conversation_id": "existing-uuid"
}
```

### MCQ Detection Rules

- **MCQ Trigger**: Only in `gather_requirements` stage
- **Format**: Uses `**MCQ_START**` and `**MCQ_END**` markers for reliable parsing
- **Limitation**: Maximum one MCQ per response for clarity
- **Options**: Labeled with A), B), C), D) format

## üìä Stage-Specific Behavior

### Stage 1: Project Kickoff
- **Purpose**: Initial project analysis
- **Behavior**: Analyzes user requirements and suggests next steps
- **Auto-transition**: Usually transitions to `gather_requirements`

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "I need help designing a conveyor belt control system for a manufacturing line"
}
```

### Stage 2: Gather Requirements  
- **Purpose**: Technical clarification with MCQ support
- **Behavior**: Asks targeted questions, uses MCQ for standardized choices
- **MCQ Topics**: Safety features, voltages, communication protocols, etc.

**Example MCQ Response Pattern:**
```
What communication protocol do you prefer?
**Options**:
A) Modbus RTU
B) Ethernet/IP  
C) Profinet
D) No specific preference
```

### Stage 3: Code Generation
- **Purpose**: Generate PLC code based on requirements
- **Behavior**: Creates structured text (ST) code with comments
- **Output**: Complete PLC program with I/O definitions

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Generate the PLC code based on our requirements",
  "force_stage": "code_generation"
}
```

### Stage 4: Refinement & Testing
- **Purpose**: Code modifications and testing feedback
- **Behavior**: Iterative improvements based on user feedback
- **Features**: Code review, optimization suggestions, testing scenarios

## üîß API Features

### Intelligent Stage Detection
- Automatic stage progression based on conversation context
- Confidence scoring for stage transitions
- Manual override capability with `force_stage`

### File Attachments Support
```http
POST /api/v1/conversations/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

message: "Please analyze this PLC documentation"
file: [attached PDF/document]
conversation_id: "existing-uuid"
```

### Error Handling
All endpoints return structured error responses:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error description",
  "error_code": "INVALID_STAGE_TRANSITION", 
  "suggestions": ["Try transitioning to gather_requirements first"]
}
```

### Rate Limiting & Cost Optimization
- Environment-based model selection
- Token limit optimization for development
- Built-in rate limiting protection

## üí∞ Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=development
# Uses gpt-4o-mini for cost efficiency
